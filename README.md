# Meet Mather
## Introduction
Originally created by David Ifkovits and Vedant Bahl, Meet Mather is currently undergoing development by Tom Wagg during the summer of 2019. We aim to have the web app running before the start of the fall semester so that students can use it to meet each other and learn more about their peers.

## Run a local copy
In order to run a local copy you need to have Flask and Python installed. The steps to running it locally are as follows:
1. Download a zipped folder of the app (green Clone or Download button in the top right)
2. Unzip the folder
3. Open powershell (or another command line interface) and navigate to the unzipped folder
4. Ensure that all requirements are installed with Pip
5. Set the FLASK_APP variable to "application" (instructions [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/cli/))
6. Run the command 'flask run'
7. Open the link that appears!
